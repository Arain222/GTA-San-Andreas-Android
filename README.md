# Introduction

*Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* is a critically acclaimed action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. Released in October 2004 for PlayStation 2, and later for PC and Xbox, San Andreas became one of the best-selling video games of its time. Its expansive world, deep storyline, and unprecedented freedom for players set a new benchmark in open-world game design.

# Plot and Setting

San Andreas is set in the fictional state of the same name, which is heavily inspired by California and Nevada. The game features three major cities: Los Santos (Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco), and Las Venturas (Las Vegas). Players follow the story of **Carl "CJ" Johnson**, who returns to Los Santos after his mother’s murder. As CJ, players must navigate gang conflicts, corrupt cops, and a troubled family, while building his criminal empire.

# Gameplay

Massive Map**: San Andreas was five times larger than Vice City, offering deserts, forests, countryside, and urban areas.
Gang Wars**: Players could take over turf, earning money and expanding influence throughout the city.

# Cultural Impact

San Andreas had a massive impact on both gaming and pop culture. Its soundtrack, featuring hip-hop, rock, and funk from the 1990s, became iconic. The game also sparked controversy due to its mature themes, violence, and the infamous “Hot Coffee” mod, which revealed hidden sexual content.

Despite the controversy, San Andreas is widely praised for its storytelling, voice acting (featuring artists like Samuel L. Jackson and Ice-T), and gameplay innovations.
